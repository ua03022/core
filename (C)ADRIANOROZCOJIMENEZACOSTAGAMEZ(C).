 incompatible, because numeric addresses have been converted to 
 pointer types:
hbwhat32: wndproc/dlgproc parameters in related functions.
hbmysql: SQLConnect(), SQLSTORER(), SQLUSERES()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   Release of 1.0.0 RC 1  June 4, 2008

General

The SourceForge repository was moved from CVS to SVN
added docs/howtorep.txt
changed pack_src.sh to extract list of files from local SVN copy using
 SVN commands

 future) which uses common dependences list. The old GNU make system is
 still functional and working
added support for pure C MSVC builds (not C++)
added rules to generate DEB packages - by Luis Mayoral taken from Debian
 distribution updated for current code
added new man pages and updated the old ones taken from Debian
fully removed flex and bison dependences in normal builds. Only developers
 who want to change the grammar files needs bison
removed all HB_COMPAT_XHB definitions from source code - now all covered
 extensions should be supported by hbcompat.ch and/or xhb library
removed 3-rd party header files from SVN, f.e.: ace.h

Portability

eliminated errno access for platforms which do not have it.
added support for PocketPC WINCE with MSVC, POCC, CeGCC and MinGWCE.
added support for cross WinCE builds

 WinCE.
added support for MS-Windows UNICDE builds.
added support for shared libraries (.sl) in HPUX builds
added large file support (64bit) in HPUX builds
disabled in default BSD* builds DOS/Windows DENY_* flags emulation
 implemented by BSD locks - tests on FreeBSD 6.2 and MacOSX shows
 that it badly interacts with POSIX locks and it's possible to create
 deadlock.

The Compiler Syntax

added direct support to compiler for ENDSW[ICTH], ENDDO, ENDC[ASE], ENDI[F],ENDW[ITH], ENDSEQ[UENCE]
 Now they are not translated by preprocessor to END what allows better typos
 detection in .prg code because each statement can use its own unique close
 directive
forbidden using EXIT and LOOP inside ALWAYS code in BEGIN/END sequence
forbidden using ALWAYS statement if RECOVER code has EXIT or LOOP
 statement
removed some restrictions on reserved words like using IF, IIF, _FIELD
 as field name
added support for (@var):<msg>

 but not supported by compiler, f.e. @func(p)
added support for HB_ENUM*([@]<varname>) functions - disabled
 by default can be enabled by HB_USE_ENUM_FUNCTIONS macro
added support for DYNAMIC functions - references resolved at runtime.

Internals  
fixed LOOP used inside SWITCH/CASE.../END[SWITCH] statements
fixed using EXIT/LOOP inside WITH OBJECT / END[WITH] statement
fixed optimization of empty BEGIN/END sequence when recover has
 EXIT or LOOP statement
 fixed using EXIT/LOOP inside extended codeblocks when loop is
 external to codeblock definition
 fixed using RETURN inside extended codeblocks when they are defined
 inside BEGIN SEQUENCE statement
many other fixes for problems which can appears in nested extended
 codeblock definitions
fixed problems with line numbering in extended code blocks
fixed compiler -w3 warning when class has different name then class
 function.
optimizations in generated PCODE and extended compile time optimizations
added support for --version compiler switch for platforms which
 use '-' as option separator
added new compiler switches:
 -q2 - disable _ALL_ stdout/stderr messages
 -kM - turn off macrotext substitution
 -ks - changed to pass base value by reference what allow full []
 operator overloading
added new compiler switches for automatic filename, pathname and path
 separators translations (-fn*, -fd*, -fs*, -fp*) used for file open
 during compilation
added support for dynamically set during compilation ChangeLog entry,
 ChangeLog ID, SVN revision and compilation flags.
 Update Harbour logo message to show the exact revision number and removed non-working compiler frontends: .NET CLI and JAVA.
added support for i18n into compiler (-j[<filename>] switch)
 gettext compatible .pot files are generated

Preprocessor

 added support for logical constants .T., .F., .Y., .N. in #IF ... / #ELIF ... PP directives

 added support for changing all -k? switches by #pragma, f.e.;
 #pragma -ks+
 #pragma -kM-
 #pragma -kx1
 #pragma -kJ0
added to PP predefined defines: HB_VER_LENTRY, HB_VER_CHLID, HB_VER_SVNID
with ChangeLog entry, ChangeLog ID and SVN revision
 added to PP support for:
 #pragma __[c]streaminclude "fileName"|<code with % result marker>

The Runtime Modules

 renamed core libraries
 cleaned code and guards all extensions to pure CL5[23] with HB_EXTENSION
 macro.
 turned off HB_EXTENSION for the default builds.

API

added C functions to access SET values (hb_setGet*()) which should be used
 instead of direct accessing HB_SET structure
added hb_fsFileExists() and hb_fsDirExists()
added hb_arraySet*() functions - they should help 3-rd party developers
 to eliminate using C stack level HB_ITEM and reduce usage of potentially
 danger function like hb_arrayGetItemPtr()
added hb_itemParamStore[Forward]() functions
added hb_dateMilliSeconds()

VM

FOR EACH detached enumerators now does not change on next iterations
added support for scalar classes with operator overloading
added full support for passing object items by reference even if they
 are not real variables but SETGET methods
added support for setting string characters by assigning FOR EACH
 iterator, f.e.: FOR EACH c IN (@cVar)
 c := Upper( c )
 NEXT
added full support for FOR EACH overloading
extended ProcFile() function - now it can accept <nLevel> | <sFuncSym> |
 <cFuncName> as first parameter, f.e.: ProcFile( @someFunc() ) or
 ProcFile( "PUBLICFUNC" ) or ProcFile( nStackLevel ). For non character
 parameters it fully works also for static functions even if source code
 have many static functions with the same name
added support for detecting not cleanly overloaded by linker .prg
 functions.
cleaned PCODE module unload procedure.
added support for executing all inherited multiple object destructors.

Debbuger

many fixes and extensions in debugger code mostly by Phil Krylov borrowed
 from xHarbour
added to debugger support for inspecting objects which use hidden
 methods and members with the same names in different classes in
 inheritance tree - now context is dynamically changed

RTL

added functions for translation to/from UTF8 mode and operations
 on UTF8 strings
added functions for bit manipulations: HB_BIT*() and for conversions
 to/from hexadecimal format
added set of functions with hb_ prefix supported extended parameters,
 f.e.: hb_AIns(), hb_ADel(), hb_AScan(), hb_RAScan(), hb_GetEnv(),
 hb_At(), ...
 added HB_FILEEXISTS(), hb_DirExists()
 new TBROWSE class which is now very highly compatible with Clipper
 It should resolve 99.9&percnt; problems with BROWSE reported in the past.
 TBCOLUMN class is now fully Clipper compatible
 many fixes and cleanups in TGET class
 many fixes to GETSYS functionality, especially 5.3 compatible features.
 many fixes and cleanups in CL53 classes like TOPBAR, POPUP, MENUSYS,
 MENUITEM and related functions.
 Made C5.3 UI classes fully working and compatible.
 ERROR class rewritten in C so now it's possible to create new error
 objects also with active exceptions
 added missing support for _SET_FILECASE, _SET_DIRCASE switches in some
 functions
 added _SET_TRIMFILENAME - when enabled low level hb_fs*() functions strip
 trailing and leading spaces from file names to emulate DOS like behavior
 added support for _SET_DEFEXTENSIONS to native all RDDs
 many fixes in Transform() function and fixed 64bit integer transformation.
 Now Transform() passes our all compatibility tests
 added undocumented Clipper error functions
- added functions to manage .ini files: HB_INI*()
 extended HB_KEYPUT to support strings and arrays.
 converted HIDDEN methods and members in RTL objects to PROTECTED for
 easier class extension in user code
 added many undocumented Clipper's C and .prg functions.
 added hbzlib and Harbour level compression functions.
 PCRE library updated to version 7.7.

Macro Compiler

 removed some restrictions on reserved words like using IF, IIF, _FIELD
 as field name

Compiler

added support for full compiler code integration with compiled programs
 WARNING: Please remember that compiler in Harbour is covered by pure GPL
 license and final programs should respect it so use compiler library
 only with programs which respects GPL.

GT

 Added new GT driver GTTRM. It's terminal GT which can be used in different
 *nixes. Unlike GTCRS or GTSLN it does not use any external libraries
 like [n]curses or slang or databases with terminal description (termcap/
 terminfo). It has hard coded support only for few terminals (Linux,ANSI,
 XTERM) but because uses only very limited set of escape sequences then
 on most currently used terminals it works better then curses or slang
 based programs. GTTRM automatically detects ISO/UTF8 terminal mode at
 startup and chose valid output what should also help *nix users - it
 resolves problems with some box drawing characters and others which
 are not accessible in ISO mode. It also respects /etc/harbour/hb-charmap.def
 like GTCRS.

 As long as user code does not execute and full screen commands then
 it works like GTSTD so can be used also for simple stream programs.
 added new GT driver GTWVG. It's works like GTWVT but has additional
 support for GUI elements
 changed GTI_* defines to HB_GTI_*
 added optional hb_gtInfo() switch HB_GTI_COMPATBUFFER which can force
 using DOS compatible video buffers in all GTs. Anyhow please remember
 that it may cause that some extended information stored by GT driver
 in video buffer will be lost.
 added HB_GTI_ADDKEYMAP and HB_GTI_DELKEYMAP to define/remove new
 escape key sequences in terminal based GTs. It's supported by
 GTCRS and GTTRM
 fixed color string decoding to be fully Clipper compatible
 OutStd()/OutErr() respects automatic CP translation when they
 are not redirected to GT screen
 added common for all GTs CLIPBOARD support. If possible low level GT
 drivers uses system clipboard otherwise they emulate it for Harbour
 application only

Multilangual

 added new lang and codepage modules: SK, BG, BE, HR, UA, LT, SV, etc.
 updated codepage code for better handling accented and multibyte characters.

RDD 

added support for memo file packing in PACK operation
 added new DBF fields like: AUTOINC (+), ROWVERSION (^), TIME (T),
 DAYTIME (@/T), MODTIME (=), binary integers with fixed decimal places, etc.
 removed limit for maximum size of relation string expression
 fixed registering workareas with numbers from 65280 to 65534.
 added SIX3 compatible library - now Harbour supports all SIX3 functions
 and extensions like triggers. The HiPer-SEEK and CFTS (HS_*() and CFS*()
 functions) was added before in hsx library. Now only bitmap filters
 (m6_*() functions) are not supported in SVN Harbour version.

Contrib

 renamed contrib libraries
 TIP library borrowed from xHarbour and adopted to Harbour
 added HBCURL - libcurl interface library. (rooted from the xHarbour version, but heavily fixed and further developed.)
 added HBSQLIT3 - SQLite 3.x Harbour callable library.
 fixes in MySQL and PGSQL library
 cleanup and many fixes in NF library
 cleanup code of CT3 library with many modifications and fixes
most of in/out CT3 functions rewritten to use GT API so now they can work
 on all platforms and with all GTs
added support for contrib libraries and new make system
 many contrib libraries borrowed from xHarbour code
 added xHarbour compatibility library: xhb. It emulates many of xHarbour
 behavior which cannot be covered by PP rules like extended operators,
 strings like arrays, one byte string in math operations, hb_enumIndex(),
 hb_QWith(), hb_QSelf(), accessing hash item using OOP interface,
 accessing/assigning string characters using [] operators (many of the
 above fully works only in Harbour but not in native xHarbour code :-))
 and many extensions like HBLOG, HBXML, HBCSTRUCT, HASH, INET*(), etc.
 added HBTPATHY - Telepath(y) compatible comm. library.
 added HBWHAT32 - Windows API interface.
 added HBFBIRD - Firebird db access interface.
 added hbcompat.ch file which hides many differences between Harbour
 and xHarbour compilers using PP directives.
 added hbmzip library - it's wrapper to MINIZIP library which
 allows for compress and decompress streams, character variables, 
 .gz and .zip files
 fixes and extensions in ADORDD
 added automatic ACE version detection during building ADSRDD
 added many new Ads*() functions wrappers and cleaned code for
 possible GPFs when wrong parameters were passed to some functions
 added HBHPDF - interface for Haru Free PDF Library.
 added HBVPDF - Viktor K's PDF Library + Pritpal Bedi's OOP extension.
enhanced and fixed HBW32 library - OLE and printing

Utilities

added HBDOT utility program. It's a "Dot Prompt" Console for the
 Harbour Language
 Syntax: hbdot [<hrbfile[.prg]> [<parameters,...>]]
 It should look and work in similar way to pp/xBaseScript
 by Ron Pinkas but unlike xBaseScript is does not have preprocessor
 or simulated runtime environment but simply uses Harbour pp and
 compiler libraries to preprocess and compile commands. It means
 that it supports all language constructions also statements, f.e.:
 "for i:=1 to 10; ? i; next"

 Additionally it can also compile and execute .prg files given as
 first parameter just like hbrun.

added many new tests to hbtest

 renamed ppgen to hbppgen.
